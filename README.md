# Term 3 capstone project: Covid Dashboard

Team Members: Rosie Quint and Zekun (Bill) Wang 

## Project Description 
This webapp is a Streamlit-based application that provides users with daily covid information for one or more selected countries. It fetches real-time data from the Johns Hopkins University CSSE Github repository. We first wrangeld the data (which we got from github) using numpy and pandas, then used plotly express and graph objects to create interactive plots for both cases and deaths for the selected countries, whee the user could switch between daily or cumulative case counts.
